Q.1 What is the difference between built-in and user-defined methods?

->  Built-in methods are already defined in Java's standard libraries and are available for direct use.
    These are provided by Java Development Kit (JDK).
    Ex. Math.pow(), System.out.println(), String.length(), etc.

    User-defined methods are those that the programmer creates to perform specific tasks according to the requirements of the problem. These are declared and implemented by the user.
    Ex. public int add(int a, int b) 
    {
        return a + b;
    }

Q.2 How do you declare and define a method in Java?

->  A method/function consists of these main parts :

    returnType functionName(Arguments)
    {
        Function Body
    }

    returnType - Datatype of return values
    functionName - Name given to the function
    arguments/parameters - input to the function
    function body - defines function task
    
//-------
Q.3 What is the purpose of void and other return types in functions?

->  void - performs action returns nothing
    int - returns integer result
    double - returns decimal value
    boolean - returns true/false

//-------
Q.4 What is the difference between formal parameters and actual parameters?

->  
    Formal parameters are placeholders or variables defined in the function declaration or definition. They are used to receive values from the calling code.
    
    Actual parameters (or arguments) are the real values or expressions passed to a function when it is called.

//-------   
Q.5 What is the significance of parameters and return values in methods?

->  Parameters are used to pass data into the function/methods

    Return values are used to return data to where function is being called
